# My Anti-monolithic Emacs Config

## About
I got tired of my big fat emacs config file.  I felt that my config was growing out of control and it was increasingly hard to make changes or try out new packages.  My config was really just a missmash of other's configs and this is my attempt to make my config my own.  Feel free to copy it :)

## Installing
git clone repository
git submodule init
git submodule update
cd into override/org-mode and run make uncompiled

## Customizations 
I have a symbolic linked directory, "personal", in my home directory to a dropbox folder I use for synchronizing my customizations, news feeds, passwords, etc.
