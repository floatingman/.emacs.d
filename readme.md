This is my current emacs config.  Most of the time I use ELPA. For Windows users, it's best to install cygwin (http://cygwin.com) and install things like grep and aspell. When initially loading the config and all of the elpa packages have downloaded then uncomment the function call (bh/org-agenda-to-appt) at the end of init-org.el this has caused problems with Invalid function: org-with-silent-modifications
